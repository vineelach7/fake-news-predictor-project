**Detection of Fake News on Job Postings**

**Introduction**
The development and evaluation of machine learning models for detection on fake news on job postings have been discussed in this project report. Three types of models have been implemented and compared in this project: an LSTM-based model, a Decision Tree model, and a Linear Regression model, using a dataset that consists of valid and invalid news articles. The aim of this project is to build tools that can be relied on for the detection of job-related postings on fake news.

OBJECTIVE
Proliferation of fake news in the job market is leading increasing disorientation among job seekers, and this is a serious threat to the credibility of any hiring process. This project will attempt to do something about this: Develop and test models that classify news articles related to job postings as real or fake. It is hoped that such solutions, to be proposed, will prove useful for job seekers, companies, and recruitment platforms in easily distinguishing between genuine and fabricated news.

**Procedure**  The project has the following steps:

- **Data Gathering**: A complete database of real and fake news articles about job postings is accrued in order to train and test the model.
  \


- **Data Preprocessing**: The data is cleaned and tokenized. This leads to preparing the data in a suitable input state for models.
- **Model Building :
Three types of models would be required to be developed: LSTM Model: Capturing sequential patterns within news articles through an LSTM architecture
Decision Tree Model: News articles can be classified based on simple decision rules from the features extracted.
Linear Regression Model: The regression approach to predict the likelihood that an article is either fabricated or not.

-   Model Evaluation: The strength of each model is used for the evaluation based on performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

-  Comparison and Conclusion: Various strengths and weaknesses are identified in each model so that future development and application can have appropriate insights.

**Methodology**

**LSTM Model** LSTM model classifies the job-related news into real and fake using a sequential feature of text data.

-  Data Preprocessing:
- Tokenize the news text, along with its word embeddings.
    The dataset is split between training and testing sets .
  
Model Architecture:

    LSTM will capture sequential patterns
    Dense layers on top of this will aid classification .
 
Model Training:
- Training using Adam optimizer along with a learning rate of 0.001.

**Model Evaluation:** 
  The performance is calculated with parameters like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

**Decision Tree Model** 
 The decision tree model uses simple rules for classification of job-related news articles.

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  Numerical representation of the news text is generated by techniques like bag-of-words or TF-IDF.
- The dataset is divided into training set and testing set.
 
- **Model Training:**
  A decision tree is trained for classifying news articles.
 
- **Model Evaluation:**
  It is assessed with parameters such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
 
**Linear Regression Model**  This Linear Regression model suggests the potentiality of the news articles related to jobs as real or spam.
 
- **Data Preprocessing:**
- Data becomes vectorized through choosing bag-of-words or TF-IDF methods.
    - The dataset is divided into two: training and testing.
    
    - **Training of Model:**
        Linear regression is used to classify the news articles.
    
    - **Model Validation:**
        Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are used to measure performance

   **Comparison of Models**
The superior superior performance of the LSTM model emerges due to a good capturing of sequential relationships in the text data. Such a model is at its best in interpreting context and determining whether a job-related news article is real or fake.
Decision Tree Model
The Decision Tree model is relatively simpler but stands as a viable alternative, especially in low-complexity and more interpretable solutions. However, it does not emerge with an elaborate capability to understand the nuances of the text, thereby limiting its performance relative to the LSTM model.

Although linear regression models are not widely used in classifying tasks, they can be used as comparison base. As its name suggests, the simplicity and implementation of this model is easy; hence, it can be used in conditions of resource-straining environments, but the performance will be overshadowed by both the LSTM and Decision Tree models.

**Future Scope and Use Cases**
1. **Future Work:** Improvement in the LSTM model will be done by the implementation of attention mechanisms to further enhance text understanding. Further extension in the size of the dataset and the implementation of the ensemble techniques in the Decision Tree to develop the model will improve the output.

2. **Application:** Practical application of the LSTM model should be given a priority in job search websites where fake news can be detected in job postings. The Decision Tree model can also be applied in a case when the interpretability is an imperative, and Linear Regression model is still a resource-friendly option that merely applies to classification.
Conclusion
Such a model would perform better than the Decision Tree model and Linear Regression model in terms of precision and reliability for detecting fake news posted in job advertisements. The edge of such a model that captures sequential information and context is assigned; meanwhile, the Decision Tree model offers a simpler, interpretable alternative to the above model. In its turn, Linear Regression is inapplicable to this task and serves just as a useful benchmark for comparisons.
